Here you can find a data tree of what we conceptually (but not practically) know about Augmented Reality. 

!> We should create a separate documentary when we go deeper in each field and then its name removes from this page.

?> If needed to have a short introduction on each line, its introduction will be gone after data tree with a H2 heading and its id should be written in the data tree.
