Here you can find a data tree of what we conceptually (but not practically) know about Deep Learning. 

```Tree
Neural Networks
	├ ANN: Artificial Neural Network
	│	├ Feed-Forward Neural network with Logistic Regression Neurons
	│	└ MLP: Multilayer Perceptron
	├ CNN: Convolutional neural network / ConvNet
	└ RNN: Recurrent Neural Network
```
