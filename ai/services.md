There is a lot of services (such as frameworks, libraries, ready-to-use trained models, tutorials and notebooks) for using in learning and training your artificial intelligence. but here we have listed the most famous ones we have discovered due to our recent researchs.

?> it's usual that after working with each services in this list, their data here can be changed. also it's possible that any other simple or complicated service can be added at the end, but simplicity is the priority, because we have not planned to be serious programmers at all, but using programming -and also AI- in our visual works.
