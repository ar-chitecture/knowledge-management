Here you can find a data tree of what we conceptually (but not practically) know about NeuroScience. 

```Tree
EEG: Electroencephalography
	├ Emotiv Epoc
	│	├ EmotivBCI
	│	└ Emotiv Control Panel
	├ Records the electrical activity of the scalp in order to examine brain activity
	└ ERP: Event-related potentials
fMRI: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
	└ Looking at changes in blood flow
EMG: Facial electromyography
	├ Measures the electrical activity of small micro-expressions made by facial muscles in response to and emotion
	└ NCS: Nerve Conduction Studies
